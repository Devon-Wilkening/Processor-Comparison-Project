# Processor-Comparison-Project


## Overview
This project serves as a comparitive analysis of a low-power processor system, represented by a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, and a traditional standard/high-power desktop system utilzizing an Intel i9 10900k CPU. The systems were individually tested and compared on a basis of five parameters: response time, CPU usage, memory usage, disk I/O speed, and power consumption. Predictions on performance were made prior to testing, with results consistently validating these predictions and highlighting the differences in performance and power between the two systems. In conclusion, the low-power system demonstrated better energy efficiency and minimized power consumption with a hit to performance, whilst the high-power system netted significantly better benchmarks in addition to higher power draw.

## Personal Contributions
Throughout the course of the project, I was responsible for setting up and maintaining the Linux Ubuntu server used to run the tests necesssary in comparing the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B and desktop machine. The open source NGINX software was utilized to launch a web server. The ApacheBench stress test tool was installed to send a given number of requests to the server. As different numbers of requests were ran on each machine, I ensured that the data was properly collected and organized for efficient analysis by collaborators. Additionally, a log was created where I documented all steps taken in producing the data, making it possible for my team to replicate and explain my findings. Finally, I collaborated with team members to assemble the project's presentation and guarantee accuracy in addition to acting as primary spokeperson for the presentation and project as a whole.
